= Introduction

== What is Reinforcement Learning?

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment.

Key concepts:
- Agent
- Environment
- Actions
- Rewards
- Policy

== RL Applications

Main application areas in 2025:

- Robotics and autonomous systems
- Game playing and simulations
- Resource optimization
- Healthcare and drug discovery
- Finance and trading

= Recent Advances

== Model-Based RL

Recent progress in model-based reinforcement learning:

- Improved world models
- Better sample efficiency
- Integration with large language models
- Hybrid approaches combining model-free and model-based methods

== Policy Gradient Methods

Key developments:

- Trust region optimization
- Actor-critic architectures
- Parallelized training methods
- Stability improvements

= Future Directions

== Open Challenges

Current challenges in RL research:

- Sample efficiency
- Generalization across tasks
- Safety and robustness
- Scaling to complex environments
- Interpretability

== Conclusion

Summary:

- RL continues to advance rapidly
